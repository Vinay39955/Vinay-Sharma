<p> VA stands for vertical alignment and is a a type of LED (a form of LCD) panel display technology. VA panels are characterized as having the best contrast and image depth among the other main types of display panels, TN (twisted nematic)and IPS (in-plane switching), but also the longest response times. As such, you may want to think twice before choosing a VA panel as a gaming monitor. However, we regard contrast as the most important factor in a monitor's image quality. So if youâ€™re looking for the best possible picture, we highly recommend a VA display..</p>
