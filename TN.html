<H1 align="center"> TN Panel</H1>
<p> TN stands for twisted nematic. This is a type of LCD (a form of LED) panel display technology. TN panels are characterized as being the fastest and cheapest among the other main types of display panels, VA (vertical alignment) and IPS (in-plane switching). As such, they work great for gaming monitors and gaming laptops. However, TN panels also offer the worst viewing angles and color when compared to VA and IPS panels.</p>
